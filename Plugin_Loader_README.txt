STEPS REQUIRED TO GET THE PLUGIN LOADER WORKING! (Working for Live 12)


1) Make sure that the "DeviceLoader" Folder for Control Surface script is placed in the location specified by Ableton Live official website - https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/209072009-Installing-third-party-remote-scripts 
	- For my current laptop it should be placed in "Users/ishaanjagyasi/Music/Ableton/User Library/Remote Scripts" 
	- I have created a new folder called "DeviceLoader" and inside it there is the py and init file. 

2) You have to then set the control surface as "DeviceLoader" under MIDI setup in Ableton Live. 

3) After this you have to send it calls through the Max Device called Device Loader (NO NEED FOR MIDI MAX FOR LIVE DEVICE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT!!)
